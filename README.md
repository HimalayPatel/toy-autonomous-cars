# Simulation of autonomous cars using Reinforcement Learning
Implemented value iteration algorithm and generated an optimal policy for cars moving in an observable, stochastic and reward-based environment.
Also simulated the policy generated introducing stochasticity using numpy random and calculated the average rewards for each car.
